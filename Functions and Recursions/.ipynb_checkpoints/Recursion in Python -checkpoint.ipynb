    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Parameters:** The function `binary_search()` takes four parameters:\n",
    "   - `arr`: The sorted list or array in which the target element is to be found.\n",
    "   - `target`: The element to be searched for.\n",
    "   - `low`: The index representing the lower bound of the search range.\n",
    "   - `high`: The index representing the upper bound of the search range.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Base Case:** The function first checks if `low` is greater than `high`. If this condition is true, it means that the target element is not present in the current search range, so the function returns `-1` to indicate that the element was not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Step:** If the base case is not met, the function calculates the middle index `mid` of the current search range `(low, high)`. It then compares the element at index `mid` with the target element:\n",
    "   - If the element at `mid` is equal to the target, the function returns `mid`, indicating that the target element was found at index `mid`.\n",
    "   - If the element at `mid` is less than the target, it means that the target element must be in the right half of the current search range. So, the function recursively calls itself with the updated search range `(mid + 1, high)`.\n",
    "   - If the element at `mid` is greater than the target, it means that the target element must be in the left half of the current search range. So, the function recursively calls itself with the updated search range `(low, mid - 1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Repeat:** The function repeats steps 2 and 3 until the base case is met or the target element is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages: \n",
    "This binary search algorithm efficiently reduces the search space by half with each recursive call, making it significantly faster than linear search, especially for large sorted arrays."
